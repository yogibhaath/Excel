# Excel
This Excel dashboard project tracks the daily number of patients visiting a hospitalâ€™s Emergency Room. The "Pivot Report" sheet shows a distinct patient count and daily breakdowns for June. The "Dashboard" sheet is currently empty, intended for visual summaries, while "Daily ER No of patient" appears to be a placeholder for raw data.
